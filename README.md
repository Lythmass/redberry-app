# Redberry Internship App

The purpose of this app is to enter user information followed by laptop information.
After that, the user submits the form and then it gets added to the list, which can be navigated
easily in app.

## What did I learn?
After completing this task, I have gained more experience in working with API's, form datas, styled components, react router and other details which have improved my skills as a front-end developer.
## Features

- Input Form for the user
- Input Form for the laptop
- Responsive Design
- Small data of uploaded image
- List of all submitted laptops
- Navigating to the specific laptop & user page
- Saving the data written by the user before it gets submitted. (Reloading doesn't lose the data)
